# unit-test-01
Initial testing of Arcadia and some basic game concepts


## goals - burn #1
1. working clojure code
2. use *defcomponent* to explore attaching behavior to an object
3. manipulate objects recursively and test building some algorithmic scenes.

## goals - burn #2 basic game components
1. Planetoid: irregularly shaped objects of various sizes (very small to very large) with heavy mass and varying gravity
2. Connector: tether, tractor beam, cable -> connection between two or more hubs
3. Hub: launch something, land on something
4. Projectile: completely independant objects that can be launched
5. Resource: collected and used to build things or traded
