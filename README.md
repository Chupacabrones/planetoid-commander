# planetoid-commander
Moonbase inspired game exploration - remotely build a network of offensive, defensive, robot-based objects that will occupy nearby planetoids.


rk:

- all player objects are robot/rover based with some amount of AI
- game is turn-based within rounds
- player basic goals are to:
  * accumulate resources
  * build
  * expand
  * disrupt, defend, and destroy other players
- possible settings:
  * asteroid fields
  * battle between two or more planetoids orbiting a larger celestial body

ek:

- little planets and astroids
- some way to tether things together
- quickly teraform each planetoid
- each planetoid is its own mini-world
   * if someone else lands on the same surface, players interact
